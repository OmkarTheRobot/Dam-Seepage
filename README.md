This project uses a NodeMCU ESP8266 to monitor soil moisture levels via two soil moisture sensors. The sensors provide real-time data to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring. It reads analog signals from each sensor to calculate soil moisture percentage and uploads the data to ThingSpeak at regular intervals.
